# BeagleBoard Chat
This software allows one to create a chat server with and communicate with
another BeagleBoard or server.

This script will probably never be used nor will it help anyone in the future
However I am just posting this here so I can look back at some mistakes I have
done.

Questions about this code? Just checkout my site @ http://johnroach.info and
send me a message.

Have fun!
